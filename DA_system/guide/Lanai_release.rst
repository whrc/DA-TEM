DART Lanai release documentation
--------------------------------

.. attention::

   Lanai is a prior release of DART. Its source code is available via the `DART repository on
   Github <https://github.com/NCAR/DART/tree/Lanai>`__. This documentation is preserved merely for reference. See the
   `DART homepage <https://dart.ucar.edu/>`__ for information on the latest release.

Dart overview
-------------

The Data Assimilation Research Testbed (DART) is designed to facilitate the combination of assimilation algorithms,
models, and real (or synthetic) observations to allow increased understanding of all three. The DART programs are highly
portable, having been compiled with many Fortran 90 compilers and run on linux compute-servers, linux clusters, OSX
laptops/desktops, SGI Altix clusters, supercomputers running AIX, and more. Read the Customizations section for help in
building on new platforms.

DART employs a modular programming approach to apply an Ensemble Kalman Filter which adjusts model values toward a state
that is more consistent with information from a set of observations. Models may be swapped in and out, as can different
algorithms in the Ensemble Kalman Filter. The method requires running multiple instances of a model to generate an
ensemble of states. A forward operator appropriate for the type of observation being assimilated is applied to each of
the states to generate the model's estimate of the observation. Comparing these estimates and their uncertainty to the
observation and its uncertainty ultimately results in the adjustments to the model states. See the DARTLAB demos or read
more in the tutorials included with the DART distribution. They are described below.

DART diagnostic output includes two netCDF files containing the model states just before the adjustment
(``Prior_Diag.nc``) and just after the adjustment (``Posterior_Diag.nc``) as well as a file ``obs_seq.final`` with the
model estimates of the observations. There is a suite of Matlab速 functions that facilitate exploration of the results,
but the netCDF files are inherently portable and contain all the necessary metadata to interpret the contents with other
analysis programs such as NCL, R, etc.

In this document links are available which point to Web-based documentation files and also to the same information in
html files distributed with DART. If you have used subversion to check out a local copy of the DART files you can open

Getting started
---------------

What's required
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. a Fortran 90 compiler
#. a netCDF library including the F90 interfaces
#. the C shell
#. (optional, to run in parallel) an MPI library

DART has been tested on many Fortran compilers and platforms. We don't have any platform-dependent code sections and we
use only the parts of the language that are portable across all the compilers we have access to. We explicitly set the
Fortran 'kind' for all real values and do not rely on autopromotion or other compile-time flags to set the default byte
size for numbers. It is possible that some model-specific interface code from outside sources may have specific compiler
flag requirements; see the documentation for each model. The low-order models and all common portions of the DART code
compile cleanly.

| DART uses the `netCDF <http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/packages/netcdf/>`__ self-describing data format with a particular
  metadata convention to describe output that is used to analyze the results of assimilation experiments. These files
  have the extension ``.nc`` and can be read by a number of standard data analysis tools.
| Since most of the models being used with DART are written in Fortran and run on various UNIX or \*nix platforms, the
  development environment for DART is highly skewed to these machines. We do most of our development on a small linux
  workstation and a mac laptop running OSX 10.x, and we have an extensive test network. (I've never built nor run DART
  on a Windows machine - so I don't even know if it's possible. If you have run it (under Cygwin?) please let me know
  how it went -- I'm curious. Tim - thoar 'at' ucar 'dot ' edu)

What's nice to have
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  **ncview**: DART users have used `ncview <http://meteora.ucsd.edu/~pierce/ncview_home_page.html>`__ to create
   graphical displays of output data fields. The 2D rendering is good for 'quick-look' type uses, but I wouldn't want to
   publish with it.
-  **NCO**: The `NCO <http://nco.sourceforge.net>`__ tools are able to perform operations on netCDF files like
   concatenating, slicing, and dicing.
-  **Matlab**\ 速: A set of `Matlab速 <http://www.mathworks.com/>`__ scripts designed to produce graphical diagnostics
   from DART. netCDF output files are also part of the DART project.
-  **MPI**: The DART system includes an MPI option. MPI stands for 'Message Passing Interface', and is both a library
   and run-time system that enables multiple copies of a single program to run in parallel, exchange data, and combine
   to solve a problem more quickly. DART does **NOT** require MPI to run; the default build scripts do not need nor use
   MPI in any way. However, for larger models with large state vectors and large numbers of observations, the data
   assimilation step will run much faster in parallel, which requires MPI to be installed and used. However, if multiple
   ensembles of your model fit comfortably (in time and memory space) on a single processor, you need read no further
   about MPI.

Types of input
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

DART programs can require three different types of input. First, some of the DART programs, like those for creating
synthetic observational datasets, require interactive input from the keyboard. For simple cases this interactive input
can be made directly from the keyboard. In more complicated cases a file containing the appropriate keyboard input can
be created and this file can be directed to the standard input of the DART program. Second, many DART programs expect
one or more input files in DART specific formats to be available. For instance, ``perfect_model_obs``, which creates a
synthetic observation set given a particular model and a description of a sequence of observations, requires an input
file that describes this observation sequence. At present, the observation files for DART are in a custom format in
either human-readable ascii or more compact machine-specific binary. Third, many DART modules (including main programs)
make use of the Fortran90 namelist facility to obtain values of certain parameters at run-time. All programs look for a
namelist input file called ``input.nml`` in the directory in which the program is executed. The ``input.nml`` file can
contain a sequence of individual Fortran90 namelists which specify values of particular parameters for modules that
compose the executable program.

Installation
------------

This document outlines the installation of the DART software and the system requirements. The entire installation
process is summarized in the following steps:

#. Determine which F90 compiler is available.
#. Determine the location of the ``netCDF`` library.
#. Download the DART software into the expected source tree.
#. Modify certain DART files to reflect the available F90 compiler and location of the appropriate libraries.
#. Build the executables.

We have tried to make the code as portable as possible, but we do not have access to all compilers on all platforms, so
there are no guarantees. We are interested in your experience building the system, so please email me (Tim Hoar) thoar
'at' ucar 'dot' edu (trying to cut down on the spam).

After the installation, you might want to peruse the following.

-  Running the Lorenz_63 Model.
-  Using the Matlab速 diagnostic scripts.
-  A short discussion on bias, filter divergence and covariance inflation.
-  And another one on synthetic observations.

You should *absolutely* run the DARTLAB interactive tutorial (if you have Matlab available) and look at the DARTLAB
presentation slides `Website <https://svn-dares-dart.cgd.ucar.edu/DART/releases/Lanai/DART_LAB/DART_LAB.html>`__ or
:doc:`DART_LAB/DART_LAB` in the ``DART_LAB`` directory, and then take the tutorial in the ``DART/tutorial``
directory.

Requirements: an F90 compiler
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The DART software has been successfully built on many Linux, OS/X, and supercomputer platforms with compilers that
include `GNU Fortran Compiler ("gfortran") <http://gcc.gnu.org/fortran>`__ (free), `Intel Fortran Compiler for Linux and
Mac OS/X <http://software.intel.com/en-us/fortran-compilers>`__, `Portland Group Fortran
Compiler <http://www.pgroup.com>`__, `Lahey Fortran Compiler <http://www.lahey.com>`__, `Pathscale Fortran
Compiler <http://www.pathscale.com>`__, and the Cray native compiler. Since recompiling the code is a necessity to
experiment with different models, there are no binaries to distribute.

DART uses the `netCDF <http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/packages/netcdf/>`__ self-describing data format for the results of
assimilation experiments. These files have the extension ``.nc`` and can be read by a number of standard data analysis
tools. In particular, DART also makes use of the F90 interface to the library which is available through the
``netcdf.mod`` and ``typesizes.mod`` modules. *IMPORTANT*: different compilers create these modules with different
"case" filenames, and sometimes they are not **both** installed into the expected directory. It is required that both
modules be present. The normal place would be in the ``netcdf/include`` directory, as opposed to the ``netcdf/lib``
directory.

If the netCDF library does not exist on your system, you must build it (as well as the F90 interface modules). The
library and instructions for building the library or installing from an RPM may be found at the netCDF home page:
http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/packages/netcdf/

The location of the netCDF library, ``libnetcdf.a``, and the locations of both ``netcdf.mod`` and ``typesizes.mod`` will
be needed by the makefile template, as described in the compiling section. Depending on the netCDF build options, the
Fortran 90 interfaces may be built in a separate library named ``netcdff.a`` and you may need to add ``-lnetcdff`` to
the library flags.

Downloading the distribution
----------------------------

This release of the `DART source code can be downloaded <https://github.com/NCAR/DART/releases/tag/v8.0.0>`__ as a
compressed zip or tar.gz file. When extracted, the source tree will begin with a directory named ``DART`` and will be
approximately 175.3 Mb. Compiling the code in this tree (as is usually the case) will necessitate much more space.

::


   $ gunzip DART-8.0.0.tar.gz
   $ tar -xvf DART-8.0.0.tar

You should wind up with a directory named ``DART``.

The code tree is very "bushy"; there are many directories of support routines, etc. but only a few directories involved
with the customization and installation of the DART software. If you can compile and run ONE of the low-order models,
you should be able to compile and run ANY of the low-order models. For this reason, we can focus on the Lorenz \`63
model. Subsequently, the only directories with files to be modified to check the installation are: ``DART/mkmf``,
``DART/models/lorenz_63/work``, and ``DART/matlab`` (but only for analysis).

Customizing the build scripts -- overview
-----------------------------------------

DART executable programs are constructed using two tools: ``make`` and ``mkmf``. The ``make`` utility is a very common
piece of software that requires a user-defined input file that records dependencies between different source files.
``make`` then performs a hierarchy of actions when one or more of the source files is modified. The ``mkmf`` utility is
a custom preprocessor that generates a ``make`` input file (named ``Makefile``) and an example namelist
*input.nml.\ program\ \_default* with the default values. The ``Makefile`` is designed specifically to work with
object-oriented Fortran90 (and other languages) for systems like DART.

``mkmf`` requires two separate input files. The first is a \`template' file which specifies details of the commands
required for a specific Fortran90 compiler and may also contain pointers to directories containing pre-compiled
utilities required by the DART system. **This template file will need to be modified to reflect your system**. The
second input file is a \`path_names' file which includes a complete list of the locations (either relative or absolute)
of all Fortran90 source files that are required to produce a particular DART program. Each 'path_names' file must
contain a path for exactly one Fortran90 file containing a main program, but may contain any number of additional paths
pointing to files containing Fortran90 modules. An ``mkmf`` command is executed which uses the 'path_names' file and the
mkmf template file to produce a ``Makefile`` which is subsequently used by the standard ``make`` utility.

Shell scripts that execute the mkmf command for all standard DART executables are provided as part of the standard DART
software. For more information on ``mkmf`` see `the FMS mkmf
description <http://www.gfdl.gov/fms/pubrel/j/atm_dycores/doc/dycore_public_manual.html#mkmf>`__.

One of the benefits of using ``mkmf`` is that it also creates an example namelist file for each program. The example
namelist is called *input.nml.\ program\ \_default*, so as not to clash with any exising ``input.nml`` that may exist in
that directory.

Building and customizing the 'mkmf.template' file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A series of templates for different compilers/architectures exists in the ``DART/mkmf/`` directory and have names with
extensions that identify the compiler, the architecture, or both. This is how you inform the build process of the
specifics of your system. Our intent is that you copy one that is similar to your system into ``mkmf.template`` and
customize it. For the discussion that follows, knowledge of the contents of one of these templates (i.e.
``mkmf.template.gfortran``) is needed. Note that only the LAST lines are shown here, the head of the file is just a big
comment (worth reading, btw).

::


   ...
   MPIFC = mpif90
   MPILD = mpif90
   FC = gfortran
   LD = gfortran
   NETCDF = /usr/local
   INCS = ${NETCDF}/include
   FFLAGS = -O2 -I$(INCS)
   LIBS = -L${NETCDF}/lib -lnetcdf
   LDFLAGS = -I$(INCS) $(LIBS)

Essentially, each of the lines defines some part of the resulting ``Makefile``. Since ``make`` is particularly good at
sorting out dependencies, the order of these lines really doesn't make any difference. The ``FC = gfortran`` line
ultimately defines the Fortran90 compiler to use, etc. The lines which are most likely to need site-specific changes
start with ``FFLAGS`` and ``NETCDF``, which indicate where to look for the netCDF F90 modules and the location of the
netCDF library and modules.

If you have MPI installed on your system ``MPIFC, MPILD`` dictate which compiler will be used in that instance. If you
do not have MPI, these variables are of no consequence.

Netcdf
^^^^^^

| Modifying the ``NETCDF`` value should be relatively straightforward.
| Change the string to reflect the location of your netCDF installation containing ``netcdf.mod`` and ``typesizes.mod``.
  The value of the ``NETCDF`` variable will be used by the ``FFLAGS, LIBS,`` and ``LDFLAGS`` variables.

FFLAGS
^^^^^^

Each compiler has different compile flags, so there is really no way to exhaustively cover this other than to say the
templates as we supply them should work -- depending on the location of your netCDF. The low-order models can be
compiled without a ``-r8`` switch, but the ``bgrid_solo`` model cannot.

Libs
^^^^

The Fortran 90 interfaces may be part of the default ``netcdf.a`` library and ``-lnetcdf`` is all you need. However it
is also common for the Fortran 90 interfaces to be built in a separate library named ``netcdff.a``. In that case you
will need ``-lnetcdf`` and also ``-lnetcdff`` on the **LIBS** line. This is a build-time option when the netCDF
libraries are compiled so it varies from site to site.

Customizing the 'path_names_*' file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Several ``path_names_*`` files are provided in the ``work`` directory for each specific model, in this case:
``DART/models/lorenz_63/work``. Since each model comes with its own set of files, the ``path_names_*`` files need no
customization.

Building the Lorenz_63 DART project
-----------------------------------

DART executables are constructed in a ``work`` subdirectory under the directory containing code for the given model.
From the top-level DART directory change to the L63 work directory and list the contents:

::


   $ cd DART/models/lorenz_63/work
   $ ls -1

With the result:

::

   Posterior_Diag.nc
   Prior_Diag.nc
   True_State.nc
   filter_ics
   filter_restart
   input.nml
   mkmf_create_fixed_network_seq
   mkmf_create_obs_sequence
   mkmf_filter
   mkmf_obs_diag
   mkmf_obs_sequence_tool
   mkmf_perfect_model_obs
   mkmf_preprocess
   mkmf_restart_file_tool
   mkmf_wakeup_filter
   obs_seq.final
   obs_seq.in
   obs_seq.out
   obs_seq.out.average
   obs_seq.out.x
   obs_seq.out.xy
   obs_seq.out.xyz
   obs_seq.out.z
   path_names_create_fixed_network_seq
   path_names_create_obs_sequence
   path_names_filter
   path_names_obs_diag
   path_names_obs_sequence_tool
   path_names_perfect_model_obs
   path_names_preprocess
   path_names_restart_file_tool
   path_names_wakeup_filter
   perfect_ics
   perfect_restart
   quickbuild.csh
   set_def.out
   workshop_setup.csh

In all the ``work`` directories there will be a ``quickbuild.csh`` script that builds or rebuilds the executables. The
following instructions do this work by hand to introduce you to the individual steps, but in practice running quickbuild
will be the normal way to do the compiles.

There are nine ``mkmf_``\ *xxxxxx* files for the programs

#. ``preprocess``,
#. ``create_obs_sequence``,
#. ``create_fixed_network_seq``,
#. ``perfect_model_obs``,
#. ``filter``,
#. ``wakeup_filter``,
#. ``obs_sequence_tool``, and
#. ``restart_file_tool``, and
#. ``obs_diag``,

along with the corresponding ``path_names_``\ *xxxxxx* files. There are also files that contain initial conditions,
netCDF output, and several observation sequence files, all of which will be discussed later. You can examine the
contents of one of the ``path_names_``\ *xxxxxx* files, for instance ``path_names_filter``, to see a list of the
relative paths of all files that contain Fortran90 modules required for the program ``filter`` for the L63 model. All of
these paths are relative to your ``DART`` directory. The first path is the main program (``filter.f90``) and is followed
by all the Fortran90 modules used by this program (after preprocessing).

The ``mkmf_``\ *xxxxxx* scripts are cryptic but should not need to be modified -- as long as you do not restructure the
code tree (by moving directories, for example). The function of the ``mkmf_``\ *xxxxxx* script is to generate a
``Makefile`` and an *input.nml.\ program\ \_default* file. It does not do the compile; ``make`` does that:

::


   $ csh mkmf_preprocess
   $ make

The first command generates an appropriate ``Makefile`` and the ``input.nml.preprocess_default`` file. The second
command results in the compilation of a series of Fortran90 modules which ultimately produces an executable file:
``preprocess``. Should you need to make any changes to the ``DART/mkmf/mkmf.template``, you will need to regenerate the
``Makefile``.

The ``preprocess`` program actually builds source code to be used by all the remaining modules. It is **imperative** to
actually **run** ``preprocess`` before building the remaining executables. This is how the same code can assimilate
state vector 'observations' for the Lorenz_63 model and real radar reflectivities for WRF without needing to specify a
set of radar operators for the Lorenz_63 model!

``preprocess`` reads the ``&preprocess_nml`` namelist to determine what observations and operators to incorporate. For
this exercise, we will use the values in ``input.nml``. ``preprocess`` is designed to abort if the files it is supposed
to build already exist. For this reason, it is necessary to remove a couple files (if they exist) before you run the
preprocessor. (The ``quickbuild.csh`` script will do this for you automatically.)

.. container:: unix

   ::

      $ \rm -f ../../../obs_def/obs_def_mod.f90
      $ \rm -f ../../../obs_kind/obs_kind_mod.f90
      $ ./preprocess
      $ ls -l ../../../obs_def/obs_def_mod.f90
      $ ls -l ../../../obs_kind/obs_kind_mod.f90

This created ``../../../obs_def/obs_def_mod.f90`` from ``../../../obs_kind/DEFAULT_obs_kind_mod.F90`` and several other
modules. ``../../../obs_kind/obs_kind_mod.f90`` was created similarly. Now we can build the rest of the project.

A series of object files for each module compiled will also be left in the work directory, as some of these are
undoubtedly needed by the build of the other DART components. You can proceed to create the other programs needed to
work with L63 in DART as follows:

::


   $ csh mkmf_create_obs_sequence
   $ make
   $ csh mkmf_create_fixed_network_seq
   $ make
   $ csh mkmf_perfect_model_obs
   $ make
   $ csh mkmf_filter
   $ make
   $ csh mkmf_obs_diag
   $ make

The result (hopefully) is that six executables now reside in your work directory. The most common problem is that the
netCDF libraries and include files (particularly ``typesizes.mod``) are not found. Edit the ``DART/mkmf/mkmf.template``,
recreate the ``Makefile``, and try again.

Running Lorenz_63
-----------------

This initial sequence of exercises includes detailed instructions on how to work with the DART code and allows
investigation of the basic features of one of the most famous dynamical systems, the 3-variable Lorenz-63 model. The
remarkable complexity of this simple model will also be used as a case study to introduce a number of features of a
simple ensemble filter data assimilation system. To perform a synthetic observation assimilation experiment for the L63
model, the following steps must be performed (an overview of the process is given first, followed by detailed procedures
for each step):

Experiment overview
-------------------

#. Integrate the L63 model for a long time
   starting from arbitrary initial conditions to generate a model state that lies on the attractor. The ergodic nature
   of the L63 system means a 'lengthy' integration always converges to some point on the computer's finite precision
   representation of the model's attractor.
#. Generate a set of ensemble initial conditions
   from which to start an assimilation. Since L63 is ergodic, the ensemble members can be designed to look like random
   samples from the model's 'climatological distribution'. To generate an ensemble member, very small perturbations can
   be introduced to the state on the attractor generated by step 1. This perturbed state can then be integrated for a
   very long time until all memory of its initial condition can be viewed as forgotten. Any number of ensemble initial
   conditions can be generated by repeating this procedure.
#. Simulate a particular observing system
   by first creating an 'observation set definition' and then creating an 'observation sequence'. The 'observation set
   definition' describes the instrumental characteristics of the observations and the 'observation sequence' defines the
   temporal sequence of the observations.
#. Populate the 'observation sequence' with 'perfect' observations
   by integrating the model and using the information in the 'observation sequence' file to create simulated
   observations. This entails operating on the model state at the time of the observation with an appropriate forward
   operator (a function that operates on the model state vector to produce the expected value of the particular
   observation) and then adding a random sample from the observation error distribution specified in the observation set
   definition. At the same time, diagnostic output about the 'true' state trajectory can be created.
#. Assimilate the synthetic observations
   by running the filter; diagnostic output is generated.

1. Integrate the L63 model for a 'long' time
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``perfect_model_obs`` integrates the model for all the times specified in the 'observation sequence definition' file. To
this end, begin by creating an 'observation sequence definition' file that spans a long time. Creating an 'observation
sequence definition' file is a two-step procedure involving ``create_obs_sequence`` followed by
``create_fixed_network_seq``. After they are both run, it is necessary to integrate the model with
``perfect_model_obs``.

1.1 Create an observation set definition
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``create_obs_sequence`` creates an observation set definition, the time-independent part of an observation sequence. An
observation set definition file only contains the ``location, type,`` and ``observational error characteristics``
(normally just the diagonal observational error variance) for a related set of observations. There are no actual
observations, nor are there any times associated with the definition. For spin-up, we are only interested in integrating
the L63 model, not in generating any particular synthetic observations. Begin by creating a minimal observation set
definition.

In general, for the low-order models, only a single observation set need be defined. Next, the number of individual
scalar observations (like a single surface pressure observation) in the set is needed. To spin-up an initial condition
for the L63 model, only a single observation is needed. Next, the error variance for this observation must be entered.
Since we do not need (nor want) this observation to have any impact on an assimilation (it will only be used for
spinning up the model and the ensemble), enter a very large value for the error variance. An observation with a very
large error variance has essentially no impact on deterministic filter assimilations like the default variety
implemented in DART. Finally, the location and type of the observation need to be defined. For all types of models, the
most elementary form of synthetic observations are called 'identity' observations. These observations are generated
simply by adding a random sample from a specified observational error distribution directly to the value of one of the
state variables. This defines the observation as being an identity observation of the first state variable in the L63
model. The program will respond by terminating after generating a file (generally named ``set_def.out``) that defines
the single identity observation of the first state variable of the L63 model. The following is a screenshot (much of the
verbose logging has been left off for clarity), the user input looks *like this*.

1.2 Create an observation sequence definition
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``create_fixed_network_seq`` creates an 'observation sequence definition' by extending the 'observation set definition'
with the temporal attributes of the observations.

The first input is the name of the file created in the previous step, i.e. the name of the observation set definition
that you've just created. It is possible to create sequences in which the observation sets are observed at regular
intervals or irregularly in time. Here, all we need is a sequence that takes observations over a long period of time -
indicated by entering a 1. Although the L63 system normally is defined as having a non-dimensional time step, the DART
system arbitrarily defines the model timestep as being 3600 seconds. If we declare that we have one observation per day
for 1000 days, we create an observation sequence definition spanning 24000 'model' timesteps; sufficient to spin-up the
model onto the attractor. Finally, enter a name for the 'observation sequence definition' file. Note again: there are no
observation values present in this file. Just an observation type, location, time and the error characteristics. We are
going to populate the observation sequence with the ``perfect_model_obs`` program.

1.3 Initialize the model onto the attractor
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``perfect_model_obs`` can now advance the arbitrary initial state for 24,000 timesteps to move it onto the attractor.

``perfect_model_obs`` uses the Fortran90 namelist input mechanism instead of (admittedly gory, but temporary)
interactive input. All of the DART software expects the namelists to found in a file called ``input.nml``. When you
built the executable, an example namelist was created ``input.nml.perfect_model_obs_default`` that contains all of the
namelist input for the executable. If you followed the example, each namelist was saved to a unique name. We must now
rename and edit the namelist file for ``perfect_model_obs``. Copy ``input.nml.perfect_model_obs_default`` to
``input.nml`` and edit it to look like the following: (just worry about the highlighted stuff - and whitespace doesn't
matter)

Executing ``perfect_model_obs`` will integrate the model 24,000 steps and output the resulting state in the file
``perfect_restart``. Interested parties can check the spinup in the ``True_State.nc`` file.

::


   $ ./perfect_model_obs

2. Generate a set of ensemble initial conditions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The set of initial conditions for a 'perfect model' experiment is created in several steps. 1) Starting from the spun-up
state of the model (available in ``perfect_restart``), run ``perfect_model_obs`` to generate the 'true state' of the
experiment and a corresponding set of observations. 2) Feed the same initial spun-up state and resulting observations
into ``filter``.

The first step is achieved by changing a perfect_model_obs namelist parameter, copying ``perfect_restart`` to
``perfect_ics``, and rerunning ``perfect_model_obs``. This execution of ``perfect_model_obs`` will advance the model
state from the end of the first 24,000 steps to the end of an additional 24,000 steps and place the final state in
``perfect_restart``. The rest of the namelists in ``input.nml`` should remain unchanged.

      adv_ens_command       = "./advance_ens.csh"  /

::


   $ cp perfect_restart perfect_ics
   $ ./perfect_model_obs

A ``True_State.nc`` file is also created. It contains the 'true' state of the integration.

Generating the ensemble
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This step (#2 from above) is done with the program ``filter``, which also uses the Fortran90 namelist mechanism for
input. It is now necessary to copy the ``input.nml.filter_default`` namelist to ``input.nml``.

::


   cp input.nml.filter_default input.nml

You may also build one master namelist containting all the required namelists. Having unused namelists in the
``input.nml`` does not hurt anything, and it has been so useful to be reminded of what is possible that we made it an
error to NOT have a required namelist. Take a peek at any of the other models for examples of a "fully qualified"
``input.nml``.

*HINT:* if you used ``svn`` to get the project, try 'svn revert input.nml' to restore the namelist that was distributed
with the project - which DOES have all the namelist blocks. Just be sure the values match the examples here.

The filter is told to generate its own ensemble initial conditions since ``start_from_restart`` is '.false.'. However,
it is important to note that the filter still makes use of ``perfect_ics`` which is set to be the
``restart_in_file_name``. This is the model state generated from the first 24,000 step model integration by
``perfect_model_obs``. ``Filter`` generates its ensemble initial conditions by randomly perturbing the state variables
of this state.

``num_output_state_members`` are '.true.' so the state vector is output at every time for which there are observations
(once a day here). ``Posterior_Diag.nc`` and ``Prior_Diag.nc`` then contain values for 20 ensemble members once a day.
Once the namelist is set, execute ``filter`` to integrate the ensemble forward for 24,000 steps with the final ensemble
state written to the ``filter_restart``. Copy the ``perfect_model_obs`` restart file ``perfect_restart`` (the \`true
state') to ``perfect_ics``, and the ``filter`` restart file ``filter_restart`` to ``filter_ics`` so that future
assimilation experiments can be initialized from these spun-up states.

.. container:: unix

   ::

      ./filter
      cp perfect_restart perfect_ics
      cp filter_restart filter_ics

The spin-up of the ensemble can be viewed by examining the output in the netCDF files ``True_State.nc`` generated by
``perfect_model_obs`` and ``Posterior_Diag.nc`` and ``Prior_Diag.nc`` generated by ``filter``. To do this, see the
detailed discussion of matlab diagnostics in Appendix I.

3. Simulate a particular observing system
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Begin by using ``create_obs_sequence`` to generate an observation set in which each of the 3 state variables of L63 is
observed with an observational error variance of 1.0 for each observation. To do this, use the following input sequence
(the text including and after # is a comment and does not need to be entered):

============= ===========================================================
*4*           # upper bound on num of observations in sequence
*0*           # number of copies of data (0 for just a definition)
*0*           # number of quality control values per field (0 or greater)
*0*           # -1 to exit/end observation definitions
*-1*          # observe state variable 1
*0 0*         # time -- days, seconds
*1.0*         # observational variance
*0*           # -1 to exit/end observation definitions
*-2*          # observe state variable 2
*0 0*         # time -- days, seconds
*1.0*         # observational variance
*0*           # -1 to exit/end observation definitions
*-3*          # observe state variable 3
*0 0*         # time -- days, seconds
*1.0*         # observational variance
*-1*          # -1 to exit/end observation definitions
*set_def.out* # Output file name
============= ===========================================================

Now, generate an observation sequence definition by running ``create_fixed_network_seq`` with the following input
sequence:

============= ===============================================================
*set_def.out* # Input observation set definition file
*1*           # Regular spaced observation interval in time
*1000*        # 1000 observation times
*0, 43200*    # First observation after 12 hours (0 days, 12 \* 3600 seconds)
*0, 43200*    # Observations every 12 hours
*obs_seq.in*  # Output file for observation sequence definition
============= ===============================================================

4. Generate a particular observing system and true state
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An observation sequence file is now generated by running ``perfect_model_obs`` with the namelist values (unchanged from
step 2):

.. container:: routineIndent1

   ::

      &perfect_model_obs_nml
         start_from_restart    = .true.,
         output_restart        = .true.,
         async                 = 0,
         init_time_days        = 0,
         init_time_seconds     = 0,
         first_obs_days        = -1,
         first_obs_seconds     = -1,
         last_obs_days         = -1,
         last_obs_seconds      = -1,
         output_interval       = 1,
         restart_in_file_name  = "perfect_ics",
         restart_out_file_name = "perfect_restart",
         obs_seq_in_file_name  = "obs_seq.in",
         obs_seq_out_file_name = "obs_seq.out",
         adv_ens_command       = "./advance_ens.csh"  /

This integrates the model starting from the state in ``perfect_ics`` for 1000 12-hour intervals outputting synthetic
observations of the three state variables every 12 hours and producing a netCDF diagnostic file, ``True_State.nc``.

5. Filtering
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Finally, ``filter`` can be run with its namelist set to:

.. container:: routineIndent1

   ::

      &filter_nml
         async                    = 0,
         adv_ens_command          = "./advance_model.csh",
         ens_size                 = 100,
         start_from_restart       = .true.,
         output_restart           = .true.,
         obs_sequence_in_name     = "obs_seq.out",
         obs_sequence_out_name    = "obs_seq.final",
         restart_in_file_name     = "filter_ics",
         restart_out_file_name    = "filter_restart",
         init_time_days           = 0,
         init_time_seconds        = 0,
         first_obs_days           = -1,
         first_obs_seconds        = -1,
         last_obs_days            = -1,
         last_obs_seconds         = -1,
         num_output_state_members = 20,
         num_output_obs_members   = 20,
         output_interval          = 1,
         num_groups               = 1,
         input_qc_threshold       =  4.0,
         outlier_threshold        = -1.0,
         output_forward_op_errors = .false.,
         output_timestamps        = .false.,
         output_inflation         = .true.,

         inf_flavor               = 0,                       0,
         inf_start_from_restart   = .false.,                 .false.,
         inf_output_restart       = .false.,                 .false.,
         inf_deterministic        = .true.,                  .true.,
         inf_in_file_name         = 'not_initialized',       'not_initialized',
         inf_out_file_name        = 'not_initialized',       'not_initialized',
         inf_diag_file_name       = 'not_initialized',       'not_initialized',
         inf_initial              = 1.0,                     1.0,
         inf_sd_initial           = 0.0,                     0.0,
         inf_lower_bound          = 1.0,                     1.0,
         inf_upper_bound          = 1000000.0,               1000000.0,
         inf_sd_lower_bound       = 0.0,                     0.0
       /

``filter`` produces two output diagnostic files, ``Prior_Diag.nc`` which contains values of the ensemble mean, ensemble
spread, and ensemble members for 12- hour lead forecasts before assimilation is applied and ``Posterior_Diag.nc`` which
contains similar data for after the assimilation is applied (sometimes referred to as analysis values).

Now try applying all of the matlab diagnostic functions described in the Matlab速 Diagnostics section.

The tutorial
------------

The ``DART/tutorial`` documents are an excellent way to kick the tires on DART and learn about ensemble data
assimilation. If you have gotten this far, you can run anything in the tutorial.

Matlab速 diagnostics
-------------------

The output files are netCDF files and may be examined with many different software packages. We use Matlab速, and provide
our diagnostic scripts in the hopes that they are useful.

The diagnostic scripts and underlying functions reside in two places: ``DART/diagnostics/matlab`` and ``DART/matlab``.
They are reliant on the public-domain MEXNC/SNCTOOLS netCDF interface from http://mexcdf.sourceforge.net. If you do not
have them installed on your system and want to use Matlab to peruse netCDF, you must follow their installation
instructions. The 'interested reader' may want to look at the ``DART/matlab/startup.m`` file I use on my system. If you
put it in your ``$HOME/matlab`` directory it is invoked every time you start up Matlab.

| Once you can access the ``nc_varget`` function from within Matlab you can use our diagnostic scripts. It is necessary
  to prepend the location of the ``DART/matlab`` scripts to the ``matlabpath``. Keep in mind the location of the netcdf
  operators on your system WILL be different from ours ... and that's OK.

        DART : Plots summary plots of the ensemble error and ensemble spread.
                               Interactively queries for the needed information.
                               Since different models potentially need different 
                               pieces of information ... the model types are 
                               determined and additional user input may be queried.
       
        Ultimately, plot_ens_err_spread will be replaced by a GUI.
        All the heavy lifting is done by PlotEnsErrSpread.
       
        Example 1 (for low-order models)
       
        truth_file = 'True_State.nc';
        diagn_file = 'Prior_Diag.nc';
        plot_ens_err_spread

      >>plot_ens_err_spread

And the matlab graphics window will display the spread of the ensemble error for each state variable. The scripts are
designed to do the "obvious" thing for the low-order models and will prompt for additional information if needed. The
philosophy of these is that anything that starts with a lower-case *plot\_\ some_specific_task* is intended to be
user-callable and should handle any of the models. All the other routines in ``DART/matlab`` are called BY the
high-level routines.

Bias, filter divergence and covariance inflation (with the l63 model)
---------------------------------------------------------------------

One of the common problems with ensemble filters is filter divergence, which can also be an issue with a variety of
other flavors of filters including the classical Kalman filter. In filter divergence, the prior estimate of the model
state becomes too confident, either by chance or because of errors in the forecast model, the observational error
characteristics, or approximations in the filter itself. If the filter is inappropriately confident that its prior
estimate is correct, it will then tend to give less weight to observations than they should be given. The result can be
enhanced overconfidence in the model's state estimate. In severe cases, this can spiral out of control and the ensemble
can wander entirely away from the truth, confident that it is correct in its estimate. In less severe cases, the
ensemble estimates may not diverge entirely from the truth but may still be too confident in their estimate. The result
is that the truth ends up being farther away from the filter estimates than the spread of the filter ensemble would
estimate. This type of behavior is commonly detected using rank histograms (also known as Talagrand diagrams). You can
see the rank histograms for the L63 initial assimilation by using the matlab script ``plot_bins``.

A simple, but surprisingly effective way of dealing with filter divergence is known as covariance inflation. In this
method, the prior ensemble estimate of the state is expanded around its mean by a constant factor, effectively
increasing the prior estimate of uncertainty while leaving the prior mean estimate unchanged. The program ``filter`` has
a group of namelist parameters that controls the application of covariance inflation. For a simple set of inflation
values, you will set ``inf_flavor``, and ``inf_initial``. These values come in pairs; the first value controls inflation
of the prior ensemble values, while the second controls inflation of the posterior values. Up to this point
``inf_flavor`` has been set to 0 indicating that the prior ensemble is left unchanged. Setting the first value of
``inf_flavor`` to 3 enables one variety of inflation. Set ``inf_initial`` to different values (try 1.05 and 1.10 and
other values). In each case, use the diagnostic matlab tools to examine the resulting changes to the error, the ensemble
spread (via rank histogram bins, too), etc. What kind of relation between spread and error is seen in this model?

There are many more options for inflation, including spatially and temporarily varying values, with and without damping.
See the discussion of all inflation-related namelist items
`Website <https://svn-dares-dart.cgd.ucar.edu/DART/releases/Lanai/filter/filter.html#Inflation>`__ or `local
file <../../assimilation_code/programs/filter.html#Inflation>`__.

Synthetic observations
----------------------

Synthetic observations are generated from a \`perfect' model integration, which is often referred to as the \`truth' or
a \`nature run'. A model is integrated forward from some set of initial conditions and observations are generated as *y
= H(x) + e* where *H* is an operator on the model state vector, *x*, that gives the expected value of a set of
observations, *y*, and *e* is a random variable with a distribution describing the error characteristics of the
observing instrument(s) being simulated. Using synthetic observations in this way allows students to learn about
assimilation algorithms while being isolated from the additional (extreme) complexity associated with model error and
unknown observational error characteristics. In other words, for the real-world assimilation problem, the model has
(often substantial) differences from what happens in the real system and the observational error distribution may be
very complicated and is certainly not well known. Be careful to keep these issues in mind while exploring the
capabilities of the ensemble filters with synthetic observations.

Notes for current users
-----------------------

If you have been updating from the development branch of the DART subversion repository you will not notice much
difference between that and the Lanai release. If you are still running the Kodiak release there are many new models,
new observation types, capabilities in the assimilation tools, new diagnostics, and new utilities. There is a short list
of non-backwards compatible changes (see below), and then a long list of new options and functions.

In the near future we will be making substantial changes to the internal structure of DART to accomodate both larger
models and machines with thousands of processors. We will continue to maintain the Lanai release with bug fixes, but we
will be updating the subversion trunk with new and non-backwards-compatible code. Checking out the Lanai release branch
and running 'svn update' from time to time is the recommended way to update your DART tree.

Non-backwards compatible changes
--------------------------------

Changes in the Lanai release (13 Dec 2013) which are *not* backwards compatible with the Kodiak release (30 June 2011):

#. The DART system uses a new random number generator based on the Mersenne Twister algorithm from the GNU scientific
   library. It is believed to have better behavior in general, and in particular when it is frequently reseeded, as may
   be the case in some perfect_model_obs experiments. The seed in perfect_model_obs is now based on the time-stamp
   associated with the data, so running single advances as separate invocations of the executable will still result in a
   good random distribution of the observation errors. The seeds in several other places in the code have been changed
   so they are more consistent in the face of different numbers of MPI tasks when executing. The random values should
   reproduce if an identical run is repeated, but there are still a few places in the code where changing the number of
   MPI tasks results in different seeds being created for the random number generator, and so the non-deterministic
   values will differ.
#. The WRF model_mod now interpolates in the vertical in log(pressure) space instead of linear pressure space. This is
   the new default. There is a module global variable that can be set at compile time to restore the previous behavior.
#. The POP model_mod used to interpolate sensible temperature observations using a potential temperature field in the
   state vector. The code now correctly does the conversion from potential temperature to sensible (in-situ) temperature
   during the forward operator process.
#. If your ``model_mod.f90`` provides a customized ``get_close_obs()`` routine that makes use of the types/kinds
   arguments for either the base location or the close location list, there is an important change in this release. The
   fifth argument to the ``get_close_obs()`` call is now a list of generic kinds corresponding to the location list. The
   fourth argument to the ``get_dist()`` routine is now also a generic kind and not a specific type. In previous
   versions of the system the list of close locations was sometimes a list of specific types and other times a list of
   generic kinds. The system now always passes generic kinds for the close locations list for consistency. The base
   location and specific type remains the same as before. If you have a ``get_close_obs()`` routine in your
   ``model_mod.f90`` file and have questions about usage, `contact <mailto:dart@ucar.edu>`__ the DART development team.
#. The ``obs_common_subset`` program namelist has changed. The program compares ``obs_seq.final`` files that were
   produced by different runs of filter using the same input obs_sequence file. The old version supported comparing only
   2 files at a time; this version supports up to 50. It also enforces the implicit assumption that the incoming
   obs_seq.final files are identical except for the DART QC and the obs values.
#. The simple_advection model was incorrectly calling the random number generator initialization routines after
   generating some random numbers. It now correctly initializes the generator before getting any random values.
#. The gts_to_dart converter now creates separate obs types for surface dewpoint vs obs aloft because they have
   different vertical coordinates. The obs_diag program (and other diagnostic routines) do not cope with the same obs
   type having different vertical coordinates because it is trying to bin observations in the vertical (it is unable to
   convert pressure to height after the fact, for example, or bin surface obs with a height with pressure obs).
#. Shell scripts which used to contain MSS (mass store) commands for long-term archiving have been converted to call HSI
   (HPSS) commands.
#. The 'wrf_dart_obs_preprocess' program will now refuse to superob observations which are too close to the poles. If
   the superob radius includes either pole, the computation of an average obs location becomes more complicated than the
   existing code is prepared to deal with. (If this case is of interest to you, `contact <mailto:dart@ucar.edu>`__ the
   DART development team. We have ideas on how to implement this.)
#. The default namelist values for the 'obs_seq_to_netcdf' program has changed so the default is a single large time
   bin, which means you don't have to know the exact time extents when converting an obs_seq.final file into a netCDF
   file. You can still set specific bins and get multiple netCDF files as output if you prefer.
#. The tutorial files are now directly in the DART/tutorial directory and no longer in separate subdirectories.
#. The default flags in the mkmf_template.XXX files have been updated to be more consistent with current compiler
   versions.
#. The default work/input.nml namelists for Lorenz 63 and Lorenz 96 have been changed to give good assimilation results
   by default. Originally these were set to work with a workshop tutorial in which the settings did not work and as part
   of the tutorial they were changed to good values. Now the workshop versions of the namelists are separate and copied
   into place by a workshop_setup script.
#. filter now calls the end_model() subroutine in the model_mod for the first time. It should have been called all
   along, but was not.
#. The 'rat_cri' namelist item has been removed from the &obs_diag namelist.
#. The preprocess program has a new namelist item 'overwrite_output' and it is .true. by default. The program will no
   longer fail if the target obs_kind_mod.f90 or obs_def_mod.f90 files exist but will silently overwrite them. Set this
   namelist item to .false. to recover the previous behavior.

New features
------------

-  Customizable Outlier-Threshold Handling

   -  Filter contains code to compute whether an observation should not be assimilated because the forward operator mean
      is too different from the observation value. This is done uniformly for all observation values and types. To
      customize this computation (e.g. to allow all obs of a particular type to be assimilated without having to pass
      the outlier threshold test), there is a new namelist item ``enable_special_outlier_code`` in the &filter_nml
      namelist that enables a call to a subroutine at the end of the filter.f90 source file. That subroutine can be
      customized by the user to do any computation required. See the filter namelist documentation
      `Website <https://svn-dares-dart.cgd.ucar.edu/DART/trunk/filter/filter.html#Namelist>`__ or `local
      file <../../assimilation_code/programs/filter.html#Namelist>`__ for more details.

-  Fill inflation restart files

   -  There is a new utility that will write inflation restart files based on values read from the console. This enables
      multi-step runs to start with the 'read inflation values from a file' option set to .true. for all steps instead
      of having to change the namelist after the first cycle. See the documentation
      `Website <https://svn-dares-dart.cgd.ucar.edu/DART/trunk/adaptive_inflate/fill_inflation_restart.html>`__ or
      :doc:`../../assimilation_code/programs/fill_inflation_restart/fill_inflation_restart` for more details.

-  New location module options

   -  There are additional options for the model and observation coordinate systems. Note that only a single location
      option can be chosen and all observations and all model locations must use that coordinate system. New options
      include:

      -  Channel coordinate system
      -  [0-1] periodic 3D coordinate system
      -  X,Y,Z 3D Cartesian coordinate system
      -  2D annulus coordinate system

      See the documentation `Website <https://svn-dares-dart.cgd.ucar.edu/DART/trunk/location/location_mod.html>`__ or
      :doc:`../assimilation_code/location/location_mod` for more details.

-  Missing values in state

   -  In some models there are values which are not valid in all ensemble members. With this release there is limited
      support for this in DART. There are still serious questions about what the correct results should be if the
      ensemble count for some state vector item is smaller than the total ensemble size. Nevertheless, with this release
      we have implemented support for missing state vector values in the CLM Land model. There is a new namelist item
      ``allow_missing_in_clm`` in the &assim_tools_nml namelist. Setting this to .true. will allow DART to avoid
      updating any state vector items in which one or more of the ensemble members in CLM have a missing value.
      Inflation will be disabled for any state vector items where one or more ensemble members have missing values. All
      CLM forward operators must test for and be prepared to return with a failed forward operator code if any of the
      interpolation items it requires are missing. See the documentation
      `Website <https://svn-dares-dart.cgd.ucar.edu/DART/trunk/assim_tools/assim_tools_mod.html#Namelist>`__ or `local
      file <../../assimilation_code/modules/assimilation/assim_tools_mod.html#Namelist>`__ for more details.

-  Different task layout options

   -  The ensemble manager has a new option to distribute MPI tasks round robin across the available nodes instead of
      assigning them sequentially. The first N tasks, where N is the ensemble size, require more memory than other
      tasks. Distributing them round-robin may allow assigning more tasks per node with a more uniform memory usage.
      This may result in a small decrease in performance at runtime, but it might allow using fewer nodes for the job
      and thus reduce the job cost. See the documentation for the ``layout`` and ``tasks_per_node`` in the
      &ensemble_manager_nml namelist
      `Website <https://svn-dares-dart.cgd.ucar.edu/DART/trunk/assimilation_code/modules/utilities/ensemble_manager_mod.html#Namelist>`__
      or `local file <../../assimilation_code/modules/utilities/ensemble_manager_mod.html#Namelist>`__ for more details.

-  Different MPI communication options

   -  The ensemble manager has 3 new options for the order in which the communication is done when transposing the
      ensemble of state vectors. There is a new namelist option in the &ensemble_manager_nml called
      ``communication_configuration`` which can have the values 1-4. If DART is running slower than expected, try the
      various options and see which is fastest on your hardware. The fastest value depends on the MPI library
      implementation, the type and speed of interconnect, the processor speed, and node memory size and so it is almost
      impossible to recommend a value without doing timing tests on the target system. See the documentation in the
      &ensemble_manager_nml namelist
      `Website <https://svn-dares-dart.cgd.ucar.edu/DART/trunk/assimilation_code/modules/utilities/ensemble_manager_mod.html#Namelist>`__
      or `local file <../../assimilation_code/modules/utilities/ensemble_manager_mod.html#Namelist>`__ for more details.

-  Several more places where large arrays were put on the stack have been removed, decreasing the total amount of stack
   required by DART.

help on adding a new model.

Changed models
--------------

-  WRF

   -  Allow advanced microphysics schemes (needed interpolation for 7 new kinds)
   -  Interpolation in the vertical is now done in log(p) instead of linear pressure space. log(p) is the default, but a
      compile-time variable can restore the linear interpolation.
   -  Added support in the namelist to avoid writing updated fields back into the wrf netcdf files. The fields are still
      updated during the assimilation but the updated data is not written back to the wrfinput file during the
      dart_to_wrf step.
   -  Fixed an obscure bug in the vertical convert routine of the wrf model_mod that would occasionally fail to convert
      an obs. This would make tiny differences in the output as the number of mpi tasks change. No quantitative
      differences in the results but they were not bitwise compatible before and they are again now.

-  CAM

   -  DART/CAM now runs under the CESM framework, so all options available with the framework can be used.
   -  Support for the SE core (HOMME) has been developed but is NOT part of this release. Please contact the `DART
      Development Group <mailto:dart@ucar.edu>`__ if you have an interest in this configuration of CAM.

-  Simple Advection Model

   -  Fixed a bug where the random number generator was being used before being called with an initial seed.

New observation types/forward operators
---------------------------------------

-  Many new observation types related to land and atmospheric chemistry have been added. See the
   ``obs_kind/obs_kind_mod.f90`` for a list of the generic kinds now available.
-  New forward operator for total precipitable water. It loops over model levels to compute the accumulated value. See

   or :doc:`../models/wrf/WRF_DART_utilities/wrf_dart_obs_preprocess`.
-  AIRS
   Fix BUG in AIRS converter - the humidity obs are accumulated across the layers and so the best location for them is
   the layer midpoint and not on the edges (levels) as the temperature obs are. Also fixed off-by-one error where the
   converter would make one more obs above the requested top level. Documentation

   file <../obs_sequence/obs_loop.f90>`__.
-  PREPBUFR
   Change the default in the script for the prepbufr converter so it will swap bytes, since all machines except ibms
   will need this now. Documentation
   `Website <https://svn-dares-dart.cgd.ucar.edu/DART/trunk/observations/observations/obs_converters/NCEP/prep_bufr/prep_bufr.html>`__
   or :doc:`../observations/obs_converters/NCEP/prep_bufr/prep_bufr`.

New diagnostics and documentation
---------------------------------

| **Better Web Pages.** We've put a lot of effort into expanding our documentation. For example, please check out `the
  Matlab diagnostics section <http://www.image.ucar.edu/DAReS/DART/DART_Documentation.php#mat_obs>`__ or the pages
  outlining the `observation sequence file
  contents <http://www.image.ucar.edu/DAReS/DART/DART_Observations.php#obs_seq_overview>`__.
| But there's always more to add. **Please let us know where we are lacking.**

Other new stuff:

-  Handle empty epochs in the obs_seq_to_netcdf converter.
-  Added a matlab utility to show the output of a 'hop' test (running a model for a continuous period vs. stopping and
   restarting a run).
-  Improved the routine that computes axes tick values in plots with multiple values plotted on the same plot.
-  The obs_common_subset program can select common observations from up to 4 observation sequence files at a time.
-  Add code in obs_seq_verify to ensure that the ensemble members are in the same order in all netcdf files.
-  Added support for the unstructured grids of mpas to our matlab diagnostics.
-  Fix to writing of ReportTime in obs_seq_coverage.
-  Fixed logic in obs_seq_verify when determining the forecast lat.
-  Fixed loops inside obs_seq_coverage which were using the wrong limits on the loops. Fixed writing of 'ntimes' in
   output netcdf variable.
-  Rewrote the algorithm in the obs_selection tool so it had better scaling with large numbers of obs.
-  Several improvements to the 'obs_diag' program:

   -  Added preliminary support for a list of 'trusted obs' in the obs_diag program.
   -  Can disable the rank histogram generation with a namelist item.
   -  Can define height_edges or heights in the namelist, but not both.
   -  The 'rat_cri' namelist item (critical ratio) has been deprecated.

-  Extend obs_seq_verify so it can be used for forecasts from a single member. minor changes to obs_selection,
   obs_seq_coverage and obs_seq_verify to support a single member.
-  Added Matlab script to read/print timestamps from binary dart restart/ic files.
-  Default for obs_seq_to_netcdf in all the namelists is now 'one big time bin' so you don't have to know the exact
   timespan of an obs_seq.final file before converting to netCDF.

New utilities
-------------

This section describes updates and changes to the tutorial materials, scripting, setup, and build information since the
Kodiak release.

-  The mkmf-generated Makefiles now take care of calling 'fixsystem' if needed so the mpi utilities code compiles
   without further user intervention for any compiler.
-  Make the default input.nml for the Lorenz 96 and Lorenz 63 model gives good assimilation results. Rename the original
   input.nml to input.workshop.nml. The workshop_setup script renames it back before doing anything else so this won't
   break the workshop instructions. Simplify all the workshop_setup.csh scripts to do the minimal work needed by the
   DART tutorial.
-  Updates to the models/template directory with the start of a full 3d geophysical model template. Still under
   construction.
-  Move the pdf files in the tutorial directory up a level. Removed framemaker source files because we no longer have
   access to a working version of the Framemaker software. Moved routines that generate figures and diagrams to a
   non-distributed directory of the subversion repository.
-  Enable netCDF large file support in the work/input.nml for models which are likely to have large state vectors.
-  Minor updates to the doc.css file, make pages look identical in the safari and firefox browsers.
-  Added a utility that sorts and reformats namelists, culls all comments to the bottom of the file. Useful for doing
   diffs and finding duplicated namelists in a file.
-  Cleaned up mkmf files - removed files for obsolete platforms and compilers, updated suggested default flags for
   intel.
-  Update the mkmf template for gfortran to allow fortran source lines longer than 132 characters.
