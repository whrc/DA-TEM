Mailing list
============

DAReS staff send periodic updates to DART users. These updates summarize
changes to the DART repository, including recent bug fixes.

To subscribe to the DART users mailing list, see
`Dart-users <http://mailman.ucar.edu/mailman/listinfo/dart-users>`__.

The mailing list is not generally used for discussion so emails are infrequent.

Discussions are encouraged on the GitHub DART 
`Issues <https://github.com/NCAR/DART/issues>`__ forum.
