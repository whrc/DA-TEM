Requesting features and reporting bugs
======================================

DAReS staff uses GitHub's project management tools to track development.

To request a feature or to request a bug fix, use the GitHub
`issue tracker <https://github.com/NCAR/DART/issues>`__ on the DART repository.

Make sure you explore the *closed* Issues! There's some good stuff in there.
