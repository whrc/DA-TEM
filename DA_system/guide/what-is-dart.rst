What is DART?
=============

The Data Assimilation Research Testbed (DART) is an open-source community
facility that provides software tools for data assimilation research,
development, and education. Using DARTâ€™s carefully engineered ensemble data
assimilation algorithms and diagnostic tools, atmospheric scientists,
oceanographers, hydrologists, chemists, and other geophysicists can construct
state-of-the-art data assimilation systems with unprecedented ease.
