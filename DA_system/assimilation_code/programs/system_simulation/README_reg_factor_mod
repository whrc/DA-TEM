The module reg_factor_mod is an attempt to deal with sampling errors
in ensemble filters using a hierarchical Monte Carlo approach in which
a group of ensembles is used and the group's sample of the regression
factor between an observation and a state variable is used to compute
an error estimate. The presence of error generally means that the regression
factor should be reduced by some factor in order to give the optimal 
result. 

The regression factor used here is computed as a function of the 
group size and the ratio of the sample standard deviation to the sample
mean of the regression coefficient. Files are generated offline for each
desired group size and contain a list of ratios, Q, and corresponding 
regression confidence factors. At present, files have been generated for
groups of 2, 4, 8 and 16. 

The first step in generating these files is to generate a file for an
infinite group size using the program sys_sim401.f90. In this case, the
only input parameter is the number of samples that are used to generate
the regression confidence factors for a series of Q's. In the results used 
to date, 1000000 samples are used to generate this. Results are generated
for every 0.01 from Q = 0.0 up to 6.00. The output from this procedure can
be found in the file undamped_base.

Because the regression confidence factor as a function of Q has a very long
but small valued tail, for computational efficiency (and error tolerance), 
the program sys_sim401.f90 has been modified to linearly damp the tail of 
the distribution for values of Q > 3.0 so that they approach zero for 6.0.
The output of this procedure can be found in the file damped_base.

Because of sampling error in the Monte Carlo algorithm used to compute the
regression confidence factors as a function of Q, there is some noise in the
results from the two steps mentioned so far, especially for values of Q 
larger than 3.0. A simple smoother is used to reduce this noise by doing 
7 point centered averages of the result for the damped case. These can be 
found in the files smoothed_damped_base. 

Next, an attempt is made, rather feebly, to account for additional sampling 
error that comes from using small groups. The program sys_sim402.f90 does
this operation. It takes as input the group size, and a sample size that is
used to construct Monte Carlo statistics as above. Again, results used here
make use of 1000000 samples. 

sys_sim402.f90 attempts to account for the uncertainty in the sample statistics
of Q that are obtained from a group of ensembles. It generates group size 
samples of a distribution with mean 1.0 and standard deviation Q. It then 
computes Q from each of these samples and finally computes the 1000000 sample
mean value of Q. In general, for all but the smallest input Q's, the mean
sample Q is larger. The value of the regression confidence factor for the input
Q is computed by looking up the value for the 1000000 sample mean Q in the 
file smoothed_damped_base. 

An additional detail includes sample instability for larger values of Q in
this algorithm. Occasionally, extremely large sample values of Q can be generated
that dominate sample statistics. To avoid this, at a cost of some error in a
very heuristic algorithm, a sample Q that is greater than 10000 is set equal to
10000 before being used to compute the sample mean of Q. The output of this 
process is found in the files regconf2, regconf4, regconf8 and regconf16. These
files are read in by the reg_factor module when a group filter is being 
executed and the regression confidence factor is computed by table lookup.

Again, there is noise in the output, especially for larger values of input Q. This
is smoothed using a simple centered 7 point average and the final output is in
smooth3_regconf2, smooth3_regconf4, smooth3_regconf8 and smooth3_regconf16. The
program smooth is used to do all the smoothing and the number 3 refers to the input
half-width of the smoother requested by this program.
