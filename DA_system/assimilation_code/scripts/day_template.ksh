# this is a template for a shell script that can loop
# over multiple days and roll over month boundaries
# or even year boundaries.  see the section inside the loop
# for the 'your code goes here' part. look for the string ADDME.
# this script requires the executable 'advance_time' to be
# built and exist in the current directory, and advance_time
# requires an input.nml namelist file.

# it computes the gregorian day if useful, and makes sure
# the days and months are always 2 digits long.

# set the first and last days.  can roll over month and year boundaries.
let start_year=2006

# <ADDME> put more stuff here if you have user settable options

# end of things you should have to set in this script

# convert the start and stop times to gregorian days, so we can
# compute total number of days including rolling over month and
# year boundaries.  make sure all values have leading 0s if they
# are < 10.  do the end time first so we can use the same values
# to set the initial day while we are doing the total day calc.

# the output of advance time with the -g input is:
#   gregorian_day_number  seconds
# use ${var[0]} to return just the day number
