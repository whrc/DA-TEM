# actual table to define factors for impacts.
# 
# the first column can contain either types or kinds because
# it applies to the current obs being assimilated.
# 
# the second column has to be kinds because it applies
# to the state (also unassimilated obs, but states only 
# have kinds so that's the most restrictive).
#
# either column can have a group name, but any group used
# in column 2 can contain only kinds.
