made consistent with other location modules, including the
revised get_close() routines.   this code didn't have any
min/max limits on the radius, and was still using lon/lat
in a few subroutines.  i put in a stub of a namelist for
the radius limits, and changed the remaining lon/lats
to azm and rad.

The location_mod.f90 for the annulus is a modified version
of ~/DART/location/threed_sphere/location_mod.f90.  The most
important thing to keep in mind in the annulus version is that
longitude actually mean azimuthal angle, and latitude actually
means radius.

The location_mod.f90 requires the parameters inner_rad (inner
radius of the annulus) and outer_rad (outer radius of the annulus)
from the input.nml.

Longitude (azimuthal angle) is in degrees, latitude (radius) is
in meters.
