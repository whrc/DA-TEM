This directory contains a short example of the format that
the converter is expecting as input.

The observations are one per line. The items on each line
should be separated either by spaces or commas.

The first two numbers are the latitude/longitude locations.

The next is the vertical elevation, in height in meters.

Then the time of the observation - day, month, year, hour, minute,
second, in this format: dd-mm-ccyy_hh:mm:ss  

The last 3 values are the actual 2 wind observation values,
U and V,  and an error estimate. The wind speeds and errors 
are in m/s.
