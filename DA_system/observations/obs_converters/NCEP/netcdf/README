This is the start of a converter from the new NetCDF format
files with NCEP obs in them, directly to DART obs_seq files.

THIS CONVERTER IS NOT FINISHED YET.  anyone interested in
doing the rest, let dart@ucar.edu know.  we'd love to use 
it instead of parsing prepbufr files.

Thanks to Soyoung Ha for the initial work on this converter.
We stopped when some of the needed information was not in
the netcdf file, but later versions of the converter are
expected to contain what's needed.
