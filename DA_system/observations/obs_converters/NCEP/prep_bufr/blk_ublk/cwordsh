#  This script will FORTRAN block or unblock BUFR files on a number of
#  standard computing platforms. Stictly speaking, real BUFR files are
#  unblocked, that is, a byte stream containing only allowable BUFR
#  constructs. On some platforms it is advantagous to use the FORTRAN
#  blocked structure for I/O efficiency, and on some platforms, when
#  using FORTRAN I/O, the unblocked structure is FORTRAN UN-readable.
#  NOTE: The script is set up to run in the Bourne shell. If you are a
#  C-shell user, enter 'sh ./cwordsh'.
