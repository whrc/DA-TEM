Unzip the data file.  Link or rename it
to clwnd_input.txt in the work directory, 
and run the convert program with tdata.in 
as input.  It will create a DART obs sequence
file called obs_seq.clwnd.

The 2005 dataset is an example of data without
the QC (quality control) columns; the 2008 dataset
has QCs.
