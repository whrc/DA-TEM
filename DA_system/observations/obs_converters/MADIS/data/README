These are example data files.  They need to be unzipped
and either renamed or be the target of a symbolic link
in order to be used with the converters.  See the html file
in the parent directory for more info on how to run
the workflow for the converters.

The current version of the converters automatically detects
if the input NetCDF files contain Data QC fields or not
and uses them if present.  There is a compile-time variable
that can be set to ignore all QC information.  See the
logical parameters near the top of the source files.

Unlike previous versions of these converters they no longer
require input arguments, except for the rawinsonde converter.
The rawinsonde converter always converts mandatory level
wind and temperature observations, and then prompts for two
logical inputs (T or F) to select whether to convert and
output significant level wind obs, and significant level 
temperature obs.

Each converter has a hardcoded input filename.  The intent
is that the calling script will copy, rename, or make a 
symbolic link to the actual input data file before executing 
the program.  Input filenames must be:

convert_madis_acars:    'acars_input.nc'
convert_madis_marine:   'marine_input.nc'
convert_madis_mesonet:  'mesonet_input.nc'
convert_madis_metar:    'metar_input.nc'
convert_madis_profiler: 'profiler_input.nc'
convert_madis_rawin:    'rawin_input.nc'
convert_madis_satwnd:   'satwnd_input.nc'
